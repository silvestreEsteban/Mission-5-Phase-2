<h1>Mission-5-Phase-2</h1>
<h2>This is a collaborative project where we are assigned to a group of 3 developers and a group of 3 UX designers. The developers are to create the design prototype given to us by the UX team.</h2>
<p>The dev group consists of Glen (@Glen357/(https://github.com/Glen357)), Jyothy (@jyothypriyac/(https://github.com/jyothypriyac)) and myself. (@silvestreEsteban/(https://github.com/silvestreEsteban))</p>
<p>We are using the agile mindset to develop this web page. More specifically, we are using a kanban board on Jira to communicate progress, we are doing daily standups which involve both the UX and the developers, and we are using iterative development as a fundamental part of our approach to this task.</p>
<p>In the iterative process, we are also engaging with design thinking practices through questioning the practicality of the design we have been given to develop, and where necessary having a conversation with the UX team to potentially improve the page (only if and when necessary). The goal is to have the final webpage be as user friendly as it possibly can be while maintaining clean and easy aesthetics, easy to understand functionality, and have no areas where the user will question how to do something. Everything should make sense.</p>

<h3>For the devs working on this project:</h3>
<ol>When cloning the repository, navigate in to the backend folder and then run the npm install command in your shell.</ol>
<ol>After you have completed this, run the npm link command, and then write listing --help to get a full list of the CLI commands available to you.</ol>
<ol>To seed the mongoDB database, run 'listing seed' and 'listing seedCarousel' this will populate the two collections with the necessary data for the listings in the project workload.</ol>
