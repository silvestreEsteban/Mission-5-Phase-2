<h1>Mission-5-Phase-2</h1>
<h2>This is a collaborative project where we are assigned to a group of 3 developers and a group of 3 UX designers. The developers are to create the design prototype given to us by the UX team.</h2>
<p>The dev group consists of Glen (@Glen357/(https://github.com/Glen357)), Jyothy (@jyothypriyac/(https://github.com/jyothypriyac)) and myself. (@silvestreEsteban/(https://github.com/silvestreEsteban))</p>
<p>We are using the agile mindset to develop this web page. More specifically, we are using a kanban board on Jira to communicate progress, we are doing daily standups which involve both the UX and the developers, and we are using iterative development as a fundamental part of our approach to this task.</p>

<h3>For the devs working on this project:</h3>
<ol>When cloning the repository, navigate in to the backend folder and then run the npm install command in your shell.</ol>
<ol>After you have completed this, run the npm link command, and then write listing --help to get a full list of the CLI commands available to you.</ol>
<ol>To seed the mongoDB database, run 'listing seed' and 'listing seedCarousel' this will populate the two collections with the necessary data for the listings in the project workload.</ol>
